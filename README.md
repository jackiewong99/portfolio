# portfolio (v1)

Welcome to the repository of the first iteration of my personal website!

:warning: _Since I am no longer supporting this version of my portfolio, the contact form is no longer functional, and the information and resume PDF file are now outdated._

:airplane: Visit the latest iteration of my personal website [here](https://www.wongjackie.com/)!
